<dl><dt><big>template <u>lazy_load</u>(alias D,alias P)</big></dt>
<dd>This nifty template will lazily-load singleton objects, only actually
 allocating them the first time they are used. This can be signifigant in a
 small application, where few or even none of the many singletons in this
 API are needed.
<br><br>
This is used internally, and is probably not very useful to the end user.
